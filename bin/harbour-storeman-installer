# Specify bash as interpreter of this script (in its first line), as this ensures
# that "-o pipefail" is available (for its use in the third line), after checking
# that bash seems to be present in mer-core at least since 2011-10-04 (see
# https://github.com/sailfishos/mer-core/bash / https://git.merproject.org/mer-core/bash )
# and consequently in SailfishOS since its beginnings (checked v1.0.0.5 per
# curl https://releases.sailfishos.org/sources/sailfish-1.0.0.5-oss.tar.bz2 | tar -tv | fgrep bash
# , as no earlier released version is available there, e.g. the first ones at
# https://coderus.openrepos.net/whitesoft/sailversion ).
# In SailfishOS releases before 4.0, /bin/sh is just a symbolic link to /bin/bash
# anyway.  Since SailfishOS 4.0, the busybox variant of ash has become the shell
# installed by default, which provides some bash compatibility (implicitly, when
# called via its bash-symlink, which is deployed by the busybox-symlinks-bash
# RPM), including "-o pipefail", but not "-o posix"; although setting
# POSIXLY_CORRECT instead seems to achive the same without compatibility issues,
# plus (when exported) also for a number of other GNU utilities.
# Nevertheless, this script is still a Bourne (not-"Again") Shell script and
# shall stay free of bashisms.

# This script is designed to be started manually, either via GUI invoker (when a
# user taps on the desktop ("launcher") icon) or directly (e.g., in a shell).
